# HDT Damage Counter
HDT Damage Counter is a plugin for [**Hearthstone Deck Tracker**](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker) (HDT) that enhances your Hearthstone gameplay experience by providing a visual representation of the minimum possible damage that can be dealt by players in the current game state.

## Disclaimer
The plugin currently only calculates the minimum possible damage from all minions on the board and any weapons or damage buffs the players hero has, it does not take into account any spells or hero powers that can be used to deal damage.<br />

## Feedback
This is my very first plugin for HDT and I'm still learning how to use the API, so if you have any feedback or suggestions put in an [**issue**](https://github.com/Asaayu/hdt-plugin-damagecounter/issues), or a [**pull request**](https://github.com/Asaayu/hdt-plugin-damagecounter/pulls) to help make this plugin better.
